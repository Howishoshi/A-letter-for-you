 <h1> Hi Noreen! it has been a really long time.</h1> 
<p>
I really wanted to talk to you again, but I know you that won't happen. 
<p>

</p>
Like, I just wanted to say that I really admired your work; your passion; discipline; and lastly- you!
<p>

</p>
Over and over again, I repeatedly dreamed the scenarios when we first met.
<p>

</p>
Vaguely, I tried to say my feelings for you- but I was still hesitating.
<P>

</P>
Even so, I tried. But in the end, It wasn't worth it.
<p>

</p>
Yet, I did not regret it. I'm happy because it happened. 
<p>

</p>
Out of heartbreak, I didn't know what to feel.
<p>
Understanding the situation made me more matured.
</p>

<p> 
I wanted this to atleast be my final goodbye...
Farewell, Alexa.
